<br>

**This is the development of the assessment given by Flutterwave during the Graduate Trainee Application Program**

- Frontend:
  - Develop an already given design blog site using VueJS (although I'll be implementing using HTML and CSS, and VueJS)
- Backend:
  - Create a transaction payment splitting service (TPSS) API in NodeJS: 
    - The service is meant to calculate the amount due to one or more split payment "entities" as well as the amount left after all splits have been computed.
